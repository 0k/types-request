#+TITLE: Types definition and exceptions for requests

* Adding =@0k/types-request= to your project

From the root of your project:

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save @0k/types-request
#+end_src

Or better, as =types-request= is still in early release,

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save 0k/types-request#master
#+end_src

To be sure to get the latest version, relaunch this last command
whenever you want to update.
